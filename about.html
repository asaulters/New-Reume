            <blockquote class="about-quotes">
            <p>"Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking."<br> <cite>- Marcus Aurelius</cite></p>
            <p>"The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do.
                You can act to change and control your life; and the procedure, the process is its own reward."<br><cite>- Amelia Earhart</cite>
            </p>

            <p class="about-p">If you've made it here, I can only assume you are currently asking yourself this exact question. That is probably a safe bet due to the fact that you are seeing
              it at the top of your page right now.<br><br>
              That is a tough question to answer though. I have been a lot of things throughout my life so far. From a internet gamer 
              who used to spend hours a day playing Everquest (kudos to those who know what that is), to a combat medic in the 82nd Airborne
               to the GM of a successful restaurant startup, to a web developer, I have done a wide variety of things in many different areas.
               <br><br>
              Through all of this though there have been a few constants in my life. Highest among these is my love for the internet and technology. Since 
              I was a child, I couldn't get enough of the internet. I was online as much as I could possibly be. This led to many nights sneaking into our 
              computer room where I would try and sneakily get back to gaming while trying to cover up the dial up tone when logging on as to not awaking my 
              parents right on the other side of the wall. I have been astounded by the complexity so many of us take for granted day in and day out.
              <br><br>
              This inevitably has led me to web design and development. Every time I click save and execute a program, page, or line I am constantly amazed when 
              what is typed happens. Very few things give me as much pleasure as seeing my work execute the way I plan and expect. <br><br>
              I have a background in many different industries and many different aspects. Let me help your business succeed by putting my background and skills to use.
